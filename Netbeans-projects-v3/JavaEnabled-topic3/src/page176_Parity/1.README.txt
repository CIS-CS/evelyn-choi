Parity
------
Parity is a simple integrity check mechanism. It can detect single-bit
errors during data transmission.
Limitations:
1. It cannot correct a single-bit error.
2. A multi-bit error could go undetected.
   For example, if two bits transpose, ie, a 1 becomes a 0, and a 0 becomes
   a 1. In this case, the data is corrupted but the number of 1's is still
   the same.
Hamming Codes
This is a technique for correcting single-bit errors, and detecting some
multi-bit errors.

Hamming is not covered in the syllabus or in the red book.
Uses a 2D array to correct single-bit errors, and detect multi-bit errors.
